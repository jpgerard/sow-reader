# Active Context

## Current Task
- Deploying enhanced proposal matching system to Streamlit cloud
- Working in feature/enhanced-proposal-matching branch

## Recent Changes
- Implemented proposal_matcher.py with hybrid approach:
  - Vector similarity using sentence-transformers
  - Text matching using Jaccard similarity
  - Section ID structural matching
  - Confidence scoring and explanations
  - Improvement suggestions

- Simplified hybrid_search.py:
  - Removed Neo4j dependency
  - Pure Python implementation
  - Combined vector and text matching
  - Streamlined for cloud deployment

- Added comprehensive test coverage:
  - All tests passing (6/6)
  - Proper mocking of dependencies
  - Coverage for core functionality

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Streamlit cloud:
   - Review deployment requirements
   - Set up environment variables
   - Deploy application
   - Verify functionality

2. Testing and Validation:
   - Test deployed version
   - Verify all features work in cloud
   - Document any cloud-specific considerations

## Implementation Strategy
- Hybrid matching approach:
  - Vector similarity for semantic understanding
  - Text matching for exact terminology
  - Section ID matching for structure
  - Combined scoring with configurable weights
  - Detailed explanations and suggestions

## Previous Stable Version
- Basic section matching functionality
- Export capabilities (CSV/Excel)
- Error handling and progress indicators
- UI features and cleanup
